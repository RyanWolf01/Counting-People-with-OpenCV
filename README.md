# Counting-People-with-OpenCV

This project uses opencv to track number of pedestrians in a video over a certain time period. After the video has been analyzed, the number of pedestrians in each 5-second  interval is inputted into a bar-chart to see trends. An adapted version of this project could be used to determine when stores, parks, etc. are the busiest.
